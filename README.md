CSV File I/O
Assignment: 171003
Completed for the LASA Advanced CS course

The “Comma Separated Values” (CSV) format is commonly used to exchange information between programs.  You may be familiar with this format when using spreadsheets.

Our task with this lab is to create code that reads and writes CSV formatted files.  This will be code that we will re-use throughout the course to access test data and report results.  The CSV format is documented in various places.  A good place to start is; “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values”

Our objective for this lab is to read a csv file and write a csv file.  We are going to read and analyze input from the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs on mortality rates.

Create an ordered list by longest lived population from 2000-2005 year group.
Where does the United States rank in the list by more developed regions (comprised of Europe, Northern America, Australia/New Zealand and Japan)?  
Where is it ranked overall?
